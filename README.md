## Amazon Purchase Reminder

## Description
In this code, we write a program that works like https://camelcamelcamel.com/.
You have selected a product on Amazon, but the product price is too high for you.
Then you announce the link of the product page and the maximum price you are willing to buy.
This program checks the price of the product on a daily basis and when the price is lower than your desired price,
it sends you an email to remind you to buy.


## How to run
run following:
```bash
python -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
